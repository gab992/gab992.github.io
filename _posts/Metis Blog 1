After my first week of Metis Live Online Data Science Bootcamp, I find myself humbled.
Looking at the curriculum, I had (and still have!) ambitious ideas of myself three months from now as a
machine learning wiz. But week one has been a dumbbell to the face, reminding me how much
work and foundational knowledge stand between me and the three-month later me I'm determined to be.

Project One was was predictably heavy in data-cleaning. MTA data that requires a good deal of investigation
and manipulation before it starts making sense. My group (much love for Mark and Lusine) had no pandas experience
and so we spent a few late nights banging our heads against the data until it was analyzable.

By the end of the week, it was time to present, and we presented what we had, which was a totally respectable
presentation! It felt rushed, imperfect, and like a result of the time constraint, but also felt like...
bootcamp.

As part of the FIRST live online cohort, we are all guinea pigs. Despite instructor efforts, there were definitely
times I wished a TA were watching me rest my head on my keyboard in frustration. I know asking for help is a solution,
but any human knows that's easier said than done.

All in all, I'm proud of my first week. I know so much I didn't know seven days ago, my python skills
have improved a shocking amount in just one week, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the rest of Bootcamp has
to offer.
